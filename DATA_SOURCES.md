# Data sources

All sources are public. Scrapers live in `src/lib/scrapers/`, run daily via
Vercel Cron, and record every run in `scrapes` (DB mode) or
`logs/scrapes.jsonl` (snapshot mode) with status, items found and items new.

## Working now

| Source | What we get | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Believe it or Not — Find a Quiz | recurring quiz listings | ✅ seeded 2026-08-26 |
| Eventfinda (Wellington Region) | recurring quiz events | ✅ seeded 2026-08-26 |
| Venue sites (Star Group, Eva Pub, The Old Bailey, Gibbons Hotel) | quiz nights | ✅ seeded 2026-08-26 |
| `example-listings` (this repo's `scripts/examples/listing-entries.json`) | seed pipeline demo | ✅ offline demo |

<!-- SEED-SOURCES -->

Projects run `pnpm run setup` to list their own initial sources here; the
scraper framework in `src/lib/scrapers/` turns each into a `Scraper`.

## Best-effort (fetched, no structured extraction yet)

| Source | What we want | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _(add sources here as scrapers land)_ | | ⚠️ |

## Key-gated (enable via env)

| Source | Env var | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _(add keyed APIs here, e.g. Eventfinda/Meetup)_ | `..._API_KEY` | Free key at the provider portal |

## Planned

- Real scrapers for the seed sources, replacing the seeded snapshot
- Headless-browser fallback for JS-rendered listing pages
- Enrichment passes (socials, contact, coordinates) with sources per field

## Rules

- Respect `robots.txt` (enforced in `src/lib/scrapers/http.ts`)
- 500ms+ delay between requests per source
- 15s request timeout; failures are recorded, never fatal
